# household ui
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

NOTE: The reason why the UI is in its own directory with a dedicated `package.json` is because it could technically be decoupled from the rest of the system.

## Get started
1. Make sure you are in `<PORJECT_ROOT>/household-ui` and install dependencies via `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn start` to start the development server
