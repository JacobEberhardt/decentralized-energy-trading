All meeting protocols are listed below ordered by date (descending).

### 05/28/19, 12-4pm: Team meeting and Midterm presentation

Midterm presentation from 2-4pm

You can find the agenda [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10DUs-q4Ll7EPuuEPqt41bd3saX75i_DbgcTOUUF4xYQ/edit#).

**Done:**

- Emo round
  - Define responsibilities clearer
  - Consensus on review process
    - Test functionality
    - Look at code
    - Quick fixes for deadline: functionality tests sufficient
- Finalize presentation and demo
- Midterm presentation
  - Why Blockchain?
    - Trustlessness: households only need to trust themselves and their component at home (which is validated by TÃœV/ Eichamt)
    - Evolution of todays system
    - Also: no one can cheat the system (immutability)
  - Security
    - Given through signing of data and transactions 
    - Household processing unit is an enclosed system
    - HHS only forwards the sensor data

**ToDo:**

- Update architecture
- Integration of VS and UC
- Make GitHub repository private and invite responsible people
- Benchmarks
  - HW requirements: Would a RaspberryPi suffice?
    (other apporach: use HW-constraint and make network as high throughput as possible)
  - Measurements
    - Processing time vs. gas consumption
    - Memory consumption
    - Conditions: time, platform to run the system
  - Ratio prosumer vs. consumer: introduce variable
  - Prices for updating contracts
- Research literature for netting algorithms
- Handling of updates to contract
  - Majority based
  - Code in smart contract allows updates and majority approves
- Failure handling (esp. HPU)
- 2 UIs 
  - One for producer/ prosumer
  - One for consumer

**Remark:**

- Introduction to ZoKrates with Jacob on 06/04/2019 2pm
- New information on setup
  - sensor-data every 15 min. (therefore netting also every 15 min.)
  - sensor gives data comparable to energy meters nowadays
    - one number increasing with consumption and decreasing with production of energy
    - rather push this number to blockchain? 
    - could be helpful in case of failure of HPU (rebuilding + restoring data)
- Where does the Utility get their data from?
    - Option 1: separate channel to provide data to utility
    - Option 2: utility goes through infrastructure to get all data
    - Option 3: ?

### 05/21/19, 12-4pm: Team meeting and presentation of prototype to Jacob

with Jacob from 2-4pm

You can find the agenda [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzuIg_V27iKG_0W1YkTX4yXUFj7ehvbZZdBTr2EM-Ww/edit#).

**Done:**

- Emo round
  - Improve communication (via Slack, especially on problems)
  - When someone has free capacity: write in Slack
  - Clear prioritization of issues (together)
- Presented current state of the different components and integration

**ToDo:**

- HHS
  - Collect deeds
  - `findLatestBlock` in DB (find and eliminate possible inconsistencies)
- UC
  - Benchmarking of gas costs and scalability
  - Integration with VS
- AN
  - Move from docker to Parity
- UI
  - Include data from blockchain
  - Rename categories ('network stats', 'deeds ticker')
- Mock Sensor
  - Include flag for focus on consume/ produce
  - More realistic data
- Update architecture
- Prepare Midterm presentation
  - Add new slide set
  - research privacy in blockchain

**Remark:**

- Midterm presentation Tue 05/28/19, 2-4pm with complete prototype
- Info on Smart Meter
  - Generally as assumed
  - Smart meter contains only the sensors and limited computational power, household processing unit is separate
  - Sensor data should be signed by smart meter component
  - Key management: node.js component either belonging to the ethereum client or key management separate from blockchain (less complex)
- Info on Midterm presentation
  - 20 - max. 30 min
  - Content
    - Goal of project
    - What have we achieved until now?
    - What do we still have to achieve and how?
  - By default: same amount of portfolio points for every team member
